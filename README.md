# **CRYPTOCURRENCIES ANALYSIS**
## **PURPOSE**
The purpose of this repository is to utilize unsupervised Machine Learning, Jupyter, and Pandas to process unstructured data, cluster the data, reduce dimensions and reduced the principal components using principal component analysis (PCA).

This analysis will be used for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. One client is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers; however, the company is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. This report includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they may be grouped to create a classifications system for this new investment. This analysis will also provide visualizations of my findings.
